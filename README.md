# Maze
A virtual reality game where the user navigates an auto-generated maze. 

Download the zip file in the release to be able to play the game.
Currently only works with HTC Vive. Viveport release in the works.
The maze algorithm is in BlockMethodsNoSuccess.cs (It's called no success, because I was experimenting with an algorithm that pre-marked blocks as correct while the maze was being created, but this isnt't that)
The code might be a bit messy as it was never really intended for anyone other than me. (Sorry)
