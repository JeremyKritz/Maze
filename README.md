# Maze
A virtual reality game where the user navigates an auto-generated maze. 
Playable game is the barebones maze. 

The Viveport ready release is almost finished, but not all here yet. (A bunch of the files are only at the lab with the Vive)
Finished: 
Movement is now in whatever direction you are facing - forwards.cs. (Yay, trig) 
The scene is now a laboratory (Think lab rat, but human)
In the works:
A tutorial scene - Tutorial.cs (its not done)
Sound effects


Download the zip file in the release to be able to play the game.
Currently only works with HTC Vive. Viveport release in the works.
The maze algorithm is in BlockMethodsNoSuccess.cs (It's called no success, because I was experimenting with an algorithm that pre-marked blocks as correct while the maze was being created, but this isnt't that)
The code might be a bit messy as it was never really intended for anyone other than me. (Sorry)
